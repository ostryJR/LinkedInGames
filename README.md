# LinkedIn Games Repair Chrome Extension
This simple Chrome extension adds the `Tango` game to the main list of games on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/games)
Because there is no API known to me, it can't display the game number and if it's finished :(

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 07.11.2024 LinkedIn started showing the Tango by default, thus this extension is obsolete.
